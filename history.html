<h1>History of HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT</h1>

<h2>History of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</h2>
<img class="img-history" src="images/html.gif" alt="HTML">
<p>The internet was created during the cold war era for nuclear bunkers
   to send information to each other. It was opened up for anyone to
   use later in 1969. In 1999, a man named Tim Berners-Lee came out
   with an idea called the “World-wide Web”, and included the language
   to write documents called HTML. HTML was basically just a tool made
   to standardize coding language so that there wasn't a ton of
   different ways to get the same results. HTML is one of the most
   popular </p>

<h2>History of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
<img class="img-history" src="images/css.jpg" alt="css">
  <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was created in 1996 by a man named
    Hakon Wium Lie, with the help of Tim Berners-Lee (the creator of
    HTML). Hakon Wium Lie was the chief technical officer at the Opera
    Software Company, and created CSS as a way to control the layout of
    multiple web pages in a site at once.
    This saves a ton of time for a web site creator,
    as they don’t have to create a layout for each web page. </p>

<h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
<img class="img-history" src="images/java.gif" alt="JavaScript">
  <p>What would later be known as JavaScript but was originally called Mocha, was created in a span of just about 10 days,
     by a man named Brendan Eich. Ever since its creation in the 1990’s, the makers of JavaScript have been competing against
     other developers like Microsoft and Adobe to take the lead in the coding world. The website Medium.com claims
     JavaScript “Has become the de-facto standard programing language of the Web”. Obviously JavaScript is very popular
     today and has been for a while, and continues to be updated to create more convenience for it’s users.</p>
